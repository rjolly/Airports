# Airports

This is an example of airport management in Play.

## How to run

Start the Play app:

```
sbt run
```

And open http://localhost:9000/

## Persistence

On the first run, data will be retrieved from the internet. Then it will be persisted on disk and loaded from there on subsequent runs, hopefully faster.
